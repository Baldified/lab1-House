It is discussed in chapter 1.
    
This is a very simple project to demonstrate some characteristics of
objects.

This project is often used after studying the "shapes" project. It
adds a class to those ones in "shapes". That class (named "Picture")
uses the shapes to draw a picture. It can be used to experiment with 
modifying source code.

************ ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ************

14.  Q- How do you think the Picture class draws the picture?     A- The picture class draws the picture by using the java code already implemented inside causing it to complete a set of commands in a short amount of time.

18. Challenge exercise Sunset: I managed to do it but I've got no idea how to prove it.

19. Challenge exercise seperate method for sunset: I successfully managed to add a seperate method for the sunset by adding public void drawn() to the source code of Picture. NOTE I have absolutely no idea how to show proof of an animated object.
